            Welcome to the Exclave! We are a community that plays games like Minecraft, Among Us, Sea of Thieves, CS:GO, Rainbow Six: Siege, and many more games.
            After reading this, please find your way to #rules so that you can enjoy your stay with everyone else. Then, go the #role-assign and react to the roles for
            the games that you intend to play. Please try to keep conversations in their appropriate channels so as not to confuse anyone intending to join in.
            To put it simply, if you're talking about the news, put it in #politics-philosophy, if you're talking about something not related to any channels available to you,
            put it in #general. You are free to contact anyone with the @Staff role for assistance in public or in their DM's, we don't bite. We hope you have a pleasant stay!
